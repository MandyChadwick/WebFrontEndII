    <h2>Week 1 notes</h2>

<h3>Report</h3>
<p>What did I do since the last meeting?
Since the start of this class, I have worked to understand what the portfolio is and how it should look and function. I have read the syllabus and studied the week one material. I still have a Sitepoint membership from last semester, so I watched the course on Mobil first design.
What am I going to do next?
I will work to make my portfolio fully functional. I will also add a CSS file so it will look better.
What are my blockers?
I have had one semester since I did Web Front End I, and I need to refresh my JavaScript and HTML skills.

<h3>Notes from Reading</h3>
<p>“When you want to get the user’s input from any input or text area tag, you use the special word ‘value.’ When you want to show something to a user, you use a section (see Section 1) and the special word ‘innerHTML.” Quote from Doing Stuff with Web Things. on  Page 44
You’ll just have to remember which word to use in these two different situations, input or textarea use value and section uses innerHTML.
More from page 44:
Line 14 in English is, “Hey, localStorage, store what’s in the storyHTML variable (box) and label that stored piece of information with what you find in the storyName variable (box).”

<h3>Notes from the Sitepoint Course</h3>
<h4>Course title: Master Mobile UX By Kray Mitchell</h4>
<p>Important points:
Quote from Joel Marsh of "The Hipper Element"
"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content and your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful".
