    <h1>This Week I worked on the Block 2 Project</h1>
    <ul>

        <li>I have worked for many hours on my block-2 project. I am mostly styling it and trying to add a bit of animation and better images. </li>
        
        
        
        <li>I need to work on the images on the dictionary and encyclopedia page. I also need to work a bit on the team activity before the meeting because they are getting quite involved.  </li>
        
       
        
        <li>I have learned that each time we see the teacher code it is way longer than I thought it would be. I must not understand all the complexity required to do these tasks with javascript. I need to understand Javascript better and why there are so many functions and steps. </li>
    </ul>
