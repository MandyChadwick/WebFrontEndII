    <h3>Chapter 8 JavaScript Novice to Ninja Notes</h3>
    <p>Forms are made up of a form tag in brackets</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a simple form</p>
    <img src="image/imageSimpleForm.png" alt="pictue of code">
    <br>
    <h3>Click Here to See the Form:</h3>
    <a href="form.html" alt="example of simple form" target="_blank">form</a>
    <p>This form has a name attribute of search, and contains two controls: an input field where a user can enter a
        search phrase, and a button to submit the form. The form can also be submitted by pressing Enter</p>

    <h3>Chapter 8 Novice to Ninja Summary </h3>
    <ul>

        <li> Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.</li>

        <li>Forms have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information.</li>

        <li>HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers.</li>

        <li>document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.</li>

        <li>form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.</li>

        <li>Forms have focus, blur, and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.</li>

        <li>Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.</li>

        <li>The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.
        </li>

        <li>The HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form.</li>



    </ul>

<h4> Definitions</h4>
    <ul>
       

        <li><b>Value</b>― This is the value of the property and is undefined by default</li>
        
       <li><b>writable</b> ― This boolean value shows whether a property can be changed or not, and is false by default</li>
        
       <li><b>enumerable</b> ― this boolean value shows whether a property will show up when the object is displayed <br>in a for in loop, and is false by default</li>
        
       <li><b>configurable</b> ― this boolean value shows whether you can delete a property or change any of its attributes, and is false by default.</li>
        <li><b>Mixin</b> ― a way of adding properties and methods of some object to another object withou using inheritance.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Chapter 12 Summary </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own
            properties and methods.</li>

        <li>The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.</li>

        <li>Constructor functions can be used to create instances of objects.</li>

        <li>ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor
            functions.</li>

        <li>Inside a constructor function or class declaration, the keyword this refers to the object returned by the
            function.</li>

        <li>All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.
        </li>

        <li>The prototype is live, so new properties and methods can be added to existing instances.</li>

        <li>The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, <br>
            JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method. If not, it will check that function’s <br>
            prototype until it finds the method or reaches the Object constructor function.</li>

        <li>Private properties and methods can be created by defining variables using const and defining a function
            inside<br>
            a constructor function. These can be made public using getter and setter functions.</li>

        <li>Monkey-patching is the process of adding methods to built-in objects by augmenting their prototypes.<br>
            This should be done with caution as it can cause unexpected behavior in the way built-in objects work.</li>

        <li>A mixin method can be used to add properties and methods from other objects without creating an inheritance
            chain.</li>

        <li>Methods can be chained together and called in sequence if they return a reference to this.</li>

        <li>Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</li>

        <li>The value of this is not retained inside nested functions, which can cause errors. This can be worked<br>
            around by using that = this, using the bind(this) method and using arrow functions.</li>

        <li>Methods can be borrowed from other objects.</li>

        <li>Composition over inheritance is a design pattern where objects are composed from 'building-block' objects,
            rather<br>
            than inheriting all their properties and methods from a parent class.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chapter 15 Notes on Modular Javascript</h3>

    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <li><b>object literal</b>― a comma-separated list of name-value pairs inside of curly braces. Those values can be properties and functions.</li>
<li><b>Parameter</b>― W3schools definition: The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments. JavaScript arguments are passed<br>
     by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations. If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value</li>
<li><b>Prototype</b>― From Educative.com: A JavaScript prototype is used to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor.</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in
            other files<br>
            and by other modules.

        </li>
        <li> ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and
            imported <br>
            into another file.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Question: </h3>
    <ol>

        <li>How is creating objects from other objects used in web development?</li>
        <li>Is what we learned in Chapter 12 used in web backend development?</li>
    </ol>
