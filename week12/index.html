    <h1>Week 12</h1>
<h2>This week I prepared for my final presentation of my portfolio for WDD 330</h2>
<h3>This Week:</h3>
<ul>
<li>I communicated with my team on Microsoft Teams. I showed them the project that I am currently working on. I got some excellent feedback from Doris. </li>



<li>I am preparing my portfolio for my final video presentation. I am going to polish my block-two project. 

What are my blockers?</li>

<li>I need to travel to see my daughter who just had a baby. My blockers right now are a lack of time to improve things beyond their present state. </li>

</ul>
