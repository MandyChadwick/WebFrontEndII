    <h2> HTML5 and CSS3 for the Real world</h2>
    <h2> Chapter8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>

    <h3>Chapter 8 Definitions</h3>
    <p><b>Transforms</b> The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element
        on the page.</p>
    <p><b>Transform Functions</b>can manipulate an element’s appearance </p>



    <p><b>Translations </b>allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. </p>
    <p><b>Scaling </b>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically </p>
    <p><b>Rotate</b> The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.
    </p>
    <p><b>Skew: </b> The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect, the x specifies
        the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew
        will only occur on the x axis </p>
    <p><b>Transform-origin</b>Controls the origin from which your transforms are applied </p>
    <p><b>Keyframe</b> is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. </p>
    <h3>Chapter 8 Notes</h3>
    <img src="transformtranslate.png">
    <p>If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey
        functions respectively.</p>
    <p>Transforms don’t work on inline elements. But that’s easy enough to fix. We’ll just add display: inline-block; to
        our span:</p>
    <p>Scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve
        them</p>
    <p>A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center; in other words, the element’s
        center will stay in the same place as its dimensions change. To change this default behavior, you can include
        the transform-origin property, which we’ll be covering a bit later.</p>
    <p>Transforms are applied in the order provided</p>
    <p>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem slow,
        drawing generally unwanted attention to what was supposed to be a subtle effect. Anything faster may be too
        subtle</p>
    <p>The most common timing functions include the key terms ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out</p>
    <p> cubic-bezier function. It accepts four numeric parameters; for example, linear is the same as cubic-bezier(0, 0,
        1, 1). If you’ve studied six years of calculus, the method of writing a cubic Bézier function might make sense;
        otherwise, it’s likely you’ll want to stick to one of the five basic timing functions. You can also look at
        online tools that let you play with different values, such as <a href=http://cubic-bezier.com/,>cubic-bezier.com
            </a> </p> <p>The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one cal lby including them as a
            comma-separated list.</p>
    <h3>Chapter 8 Questions</h3>
    <p>Are there any API libraries that help with transform and translate?</p>
    <p>Are all graphics based around an origin?</p>

        Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>

    <h3>Chapter 12 Definitions</h3>
    <p><b>Canvas</b>
        With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript</p>









        <h3>Canvas Demonstration</h3>
        <p>I found this canvas demo at <a href= "https://codepen.io/tha-Sup3rN0va/pen/PoOpbay">this</a> codepen</p>
        <canvas id='canvas'></canvas>




    <p><b>SVG</b>
        SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics
        using XML. </p>
        <h3>Here is an SVG I made from a photo on Adobe Illustrator </h3>
        <img
    src="barrell14.svg"
    alt="barrell cactus svg"
    height="300"
     />
    <p><b>Vector Graphics</b>
        vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up or shrink them down.</p>
    <p><b>XML</b>
        stands for eXtensible Markup Language. Like HTML, it’s a markup metalanguage. In plain English, it’s a system
        meant to annotate text.</p>


        <p><b>Drag and Drop API </b>allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page</p>
    <h3>Chapter 12 Notes</h3>

    <p>As you may have gathered, the coordinate system in the canvas element is different from the Cartesian coordinate
        system you learned in math class. In the canvas coordinate system, the top-left corner is (0,0). If the canvas
        is 200 pixels by 200 pixels, then the bottom-right corner is (200,200), as Figure 12.3 illustrates.</p>
    <p>Canvas is an API that allows for drawing and changing drawings. It is quite powerful and can even be used with
        Javascript to change a colored movie to black and white. </p>
    <p> One way to create SVG files is in an open source program is a program called Inkscape. <a href=" http://inkscape.org/">Click Here To See Inkscape</a> </p>
    <p>When creating graphics you can start with open source materials. Here is a good resource <a href="http://openclipart.org/," target = "blank">Openclipart.org</a></p>
    <p>Raphaeljs is an open source library that makes animating with javascript easier. <a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">raphaeljs.com</a></p>
    <h3>Chapter 12 Questions</h3>
    <p>When using raphael and the other libraries and APIs do you need to import the library into the HTML or Javascript file? How is that done?</p>
    <p> Is Xml used in many different programs?</p>
