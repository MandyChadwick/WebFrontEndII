    <h2>Chapter 10 Java Novice To Ninja Notes:</h2>
    <h3>Errors Exceptions and Warnings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>

        <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
        
        <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Definitions
    </h3>
    <p><b>Exceptions: </b>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
    <p><b>Stack Traces: </b>a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</p>
    <p><b>Warning: </b>occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.</p>
    <p><b>Strict Mode: </b>produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.</p>
    <p><b>Linting Tools: </b>used to test the quality of JavaScript code.</p>
    <p><b>Error Object: </b> can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs. <br>
    
   </p>
    <p><b>Test Driven Development (TDD): </b>the process of writing tests before any actual code.</p>

    <p><b>Test Driven Development Steps: </b>Write tests (that initially fail), Write code to pass the tests, Refactor the code, Test refactored code, Write more tests for new features.
    </p>
    <p><b>Jest: </b> a TDD framework, created by Facebook, that has gained a lot of popularity recently. It makes it easy to create and run tests by providing helper methods for common test assertions.</p>



    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <Ul>
        <li>Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.</li>

        <li>JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string "use strict". This can be used in a whole file or
            just a single function.</li>

        <li>Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practice and conventions.</li>

        <li>Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception
            being thrown.</li>

        <li>The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.
        </li>

        <li>Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.</li>

        <li>An error object is created when an exception occurs.</li>

        <li>Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs.</li>
           <li> Any code inside a finally block will run if an exception does or does not occur.</li>

        <li>Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the<br>
        test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.</li>

        <li>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</li>
