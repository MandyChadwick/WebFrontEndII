    <h2>Chapter 9 The Window Object JavaScript Novice to Ninja</h2>
    <h3>Definitions Chapter 9</h3>

    <p><b>Global Object</b>In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>
    <p><b>Browser Object Model</b>is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</p>
    <p><b>Navigator object</b> contains information about the browser being used.</p>
    <p><b>Window.location </b>an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. </p>
    <p><b>The window.history property</b>. can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session.</p>
    <p><b>Cookies</b>small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. </p>
   
    <h3>Notes Chapter 9</h3>
    <p>Node.js has an object called global.</p>
    <p>In Chapter 1, we introduced three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt(). It’s worth reiterating again that these methods will stop the execution of a program in its tracks. </p>
    <p>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain:</p>

       <P>
        window.location.pathname</P>
        <p> "/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"</p>
    <p>The close() method can be used to close a window, assuming you have a reference to it:</p>
    <p> Browsers can sometimes hold on to information stored in a cookie that should have expired when the “session restore” feature is used after a crash.</p>

        
       <p> popup.close();</p>
    <p>Cookies can store information that can then be retrieved between requests.</p>
    <p>Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart)</p>
    <p>To remove a cookie, you need to set it to expire at a time in the past:</p>
    <p>The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals.

        The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. Try entering the following example into a console. It should show an alert dialog after three seconds (that’s 3000 milliseconds):</p>
    <h3>Example Chapter 9</h3>
    
    <P>Here is an Example of an Animation</P>
    <a href = animation.html target = blank>click here</a>
    <h3>Summary Chapter 9</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The window object is the global object in a browser.</li>

        <li>Global variables are actually properties of the window object in a browser environment.</li>
        
        <li>alert, confirm(), and prompt() are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the </execution of the program.</li>
        
        <li>The window.navigator object gives information about the user’s browser and operating system, although it can be unreliable.</li>
        
        <li>The window.location object provides information about the URL of the current page.</li>
        
        <li>The window.history object keeps information about the pages that have been visited in the session.</li>
        
        <li>You can open, close, resize, and move windows (although, this doesn’t mean you should!).</li>
        
        <li>The window.screen object provides information about the user’s screen.</li>
        
        <li>document.write() is an archaic method of writing text to the document and should be avoided.</li>
        
        <li>Cookies can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property.</li>
        
        <li>The window.setTimeout() method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time. It can be canceled using the clearTimeout() method.</li>
       
        <li>The window.setInterval() method can be used to repeatedly invoke a function. It can be stopped using the clearInterval() method.</li>
        
        <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing </li>the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.




    </ul>
    <h3>Questions Chapter 9</h3>
    <p>Who had access to the window.navigator object?</p>
    <p>Why is windows.confirm even available it seems like it would just cause problems. </p>

    <h2>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs JavaScript Novice to Ninja</h2>

    <h3>Definitions Chapter 14</h3>
    <p><b>The data- attribute </b>is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.</p>
    <p><b> localStorage</b>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. The information is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings. </p>
    <p><b>Geolocation API  </b>used to obtain the geographical position of the device. </p>
    <p><b>The position object </b>has a coords property with a latitude and longitude property</p>
    <p><b>Web Workers</b>allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript which only allows one process at a time</p>
    <p><b>Websocket</b> is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server - also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are 'pushed to the client as soon as they are recieved.</p>
    <p><b>Notification API</b> allows you to show messages using the system's notifications.</p>
    <h3>Notes Chapter 14</h3>
    <p>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed.
    </p>
  <p>The Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies:

   <ul> <li>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request.</li>
    
    <li>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same).</li>
    
    <li>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies ( There is no actual limit in the specification, but most browsers have a limit set at 5GB per domain.).</li>
    
   <li> Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies. This potentially makes cookies a better choice for something like showing a popup once a day.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>This creates JSON: localStorage.setItem('superman', JSON.stringify(hero);</p>
<p></p>
  <h3>Example from Chapter 14</h3>
  <a href = "factor.html" target = blank>Click here for an example of Two part program</a>
    <h3>Summary Chapter 14</h3>
    <ul>
<li>HTML5.1 is the latest incarnation of the Hypertext Markup Language. It covers a variety of technologies, including several APIs that are accessible using JavaScript.</li>

<li>data- attributes help to embed custom data into a web page that can then be used to enhance the user experience with JavaScript.</li>

<li>The Web Storage API allows key-value pairs to be stored on the user’s device in a similar way to cookies, but without the same storage restrictions.</li>

<li>The Geolocation API allows you to access the geographic coordinates of the user’s device, as long as the user gives permission.</li>

<li>The Web Worker API can be used to perform computationally intensive tasks in the background, which helps to avoid websites becoming unresponsive.</li>

<li>Websockets are a new protocol for communicating over the internet, and allow real-time, two-way communication.</li>

<li>The Notification API allows you to display notifications on the user's system.</li>

<li>The audio and video elements can be employed to embed audio tracks and video clips in a web page. They also have a Media API that can help control the playback using JavaScript.</li>

<li>The canvas element can be used to dynamically draw geometric shapes, text, and images on a web page in real-time using JavaScript.</li>

<li>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers.</li>


</ul>
    <h3>Questions Chapter 14</h3>
    <p> Are all these APIs part of the browsers or just accessed by them?</p>
    <p>Why would you need to program play into a video.  Is that like when some one scrolls over it?</p>
