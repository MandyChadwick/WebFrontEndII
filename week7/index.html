        Chapter 13 AJAX</h1>
    <h2>From JavaScript Novice to Ninja</h2>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>If a function takes some time to compute a return value, we can save the result in a cache property.</p>
    <p>One of the core tenets of functional programming: it allows generic higher-order functions to be used to return
        more specific functions based on particular parameters.</p>

    <p>It is possible to make a temporary function like this</p>

    <h3>Definitions From Chapter 11:</h3>
    <p><b>Immediately Invoked Function Expression – or IIFE</b> – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that, as
        the name suggests, is invoked as soon as it’s defined.</p>
    <p><b>Generators</b> are special functions used to produce iterators that maintain the state of a value.</p>
    <p><b>function*</b> declaration ( function keyword followed by an asterisk) defines a generator function, which
        returns a Generator object.</p>

    <p><b>Yield</b>the keyword is used to return a value. The difference between the yield and the return keywords is
        that by using yield, the state of the value returned is remembered the next time</p>
    <p><b>Functional programming</b> uses pure functions as the building blocks of a program. The functions perform a
        series of operations without changing the state of any data. Each function forms an abstraction that should
        perform a single task, while encapsulating the details of its implementation inside the body of the function.
        This means that a program becomes a sequence of expressions based on the return values of pure functions. The
        emphasis is placed on using function composition to combine pure functions together to complete more complex
        tasks.</p>
    <p><b>Higher Order Functions: </b>accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or
        both.</p>
    <p><b>Currying</b> Named after Haskell Curry and it is when a function only partially applies its functions and some
        are left to be resolved by other data. A final result is only returned once all the expected arguments have
        eventually been provided.</p>

    <h3>Definitions From Chapter 13</h3>
    <p><b>Ajax </b>is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically
        updates web pages without reloading.</p>
    <p><b>The same-origin policy </b>in browsers blocks all requests from a domain that is different from the page
        making the request</p>
    <p><b>Cross-origin resource</b> sharing (CORS) is a solution to this problem as it allows resources to be requested
        from another website outside the original domain. </p>
    <p><b>Asynchronous loading techniques: </b> started to be noticed when Google launched Gmail and Google Maps in 2004
        and 2005 respectively. These web applications used asynchronous loading techniques to enhance the user
        experience by changing the parts of the page without a full refresh. This gave them a much snappier and
        responsive quality that felt more like a desktop application.</p>
    <p><b>CORS</b> cross-origin resource sharing. It is a solution to this problem as it allows resources to be
        requested from another website outside the original domain.</p>
    <p><b>The redirect() method </b>can be used to redirect to another URL. It creates a new promise that resolves to
        the response from the redirected URL.At the present time, there is no support for the redirect() method in any
        browser.</p>
    <p><b>The blob() method</b>> is used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses</p>

    <p><b>GET</b> requests to retrieve resources from the web. By default, a link in a web page will make a GET request.
        Forms are also submitted using a GET request by default, but they will often use a POST request.</p>

    <p><b>POST</b> requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task from the web</p>

    <p><b>PUT</b> requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely</p>

    <p><b>PATCH</b> requests to make partial updates to a resource</p>

    <p><b>DELETE</b> requests to delete a resources.</p>

    <h2>Question:</h2>
    <h4>Is much of this type of coding found in Chapters 11 and 13 used in backend web development?

    </h4>
    <h2>Chapter Summary Chapter 11</h2>
    <ul><li>Functions have built-in properties such as length, but can have custom properties added.</li>

        <li>All functions have call() and apply() methods that can invoke a function with the value of this bound to an
            object that is provided as an argument.</li>

        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions or IIFEs are functions that are enclosed in parentheses and
            immediately followed by double parentheses so they’re invoked. They are useful for namespacing variables and
            setting default values.</li>

        <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function, depending on certain
            conditions.</li>

        <li>A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.</li>

        <li>A callback is a function that’s provided as an argument to another function.</li>

        <li>Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. This means that a
            program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for another task to be completed.</li>

        <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also
            provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.</li>

        <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>

        <li>A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it
            was originally defined in.</li>

        <li>A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.</li>

        <li>A generator function will return an iterator object that provides a next() method, which returns the next
            value in a sequence that is defined in the generator function.</li>

        <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as a series of
            functions.</li>

        <li>Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called from, have no
            side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments (referential transparency).</li>

        <li>Currying or partial application is the process of applying one argument at a time to a function. A new
            function is returned until all the arguments have been used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chapter Summary Chapter 13</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>

        <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>

        <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.</li>

        <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>

        <li>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>

        <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create your own
            response objects.</li>

        <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the request
            being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>

        <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response object.
        </li>

        <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>

        <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>
    </ul>
